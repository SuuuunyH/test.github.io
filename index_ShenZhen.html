				<p>Shenzhen is located in the south of Guangdong Province. Shenzhen is the first special economic zone set up in China, the window of China's reform and opening up and a new immigrant city. It has developed into an influential modern and international metropolis. Now, it plays an important role in China's high-tech industries, financial services, foreign trade exports, marine transport, creative culture and so on. </p>

					<p>However, with the rapid development of Shenzhen's economy and the high level of urbanization, there are some serious problems, which are ignored by many people - the phenomenon of village in city. City village, as the name implies, the countryside in the city, in fact, is the rural settlement in the city after the village farmland is taken away, the remaining homestead is surrounded by the city. The village in the city is an organic part of a city. The urban village in Shenzhen is growing with the development of economy; it undertakes the heavy responsibility of low-rent housing and reduces the operation cost of the whole city, but it also brings serious economic, social and environmental problems to Shenzhen. </p>

					<p>In terms of economy, the existence of villages in cities has caused the diseconomy of land use. A large number of urban villages are located in various districts of Shenzhen, occupying valuable urban construction sites. In terms of environment, most urban villages are backward in planning and lack the necessary infrastructure. All kinds of pipelines are in disorder, sewage is discharged randomly, rubbish is piled up, mosquitoes and flies are bred, and living conditions are bad. High-density buildings and population make urban villages have huge fire hazards and epidemic hidden dangers, once a fire and epidemic, fire engines and ambulances will not be able to pass. </p>

					<p>On the social side. The first is security. Owing to the owner's pursuit of maximum rent, rental houses in urban villages can be rented as long as they pay. Most people who rent in urban villages have low income and strong mobility, and can move from one village to another at any time. The buildings in urban villages are cluttered and dense, with low rent, strong concealment, loose management and high population density. Circumstances provide  convenience for criminals to hide.</p>

					<p>Wind and apartment demolitions are imminent in Baishizhou, Shenzhen's largest city village. Tenants are required to move out before June 5, and a stage of life will be scattered. Take the renovation of the village in Shenzhen as an example, some people hope to be able to demolish early, get a move money; some people choose to become "nail households" in the hope of gaining more profits; for some second landlords, hope to renovate the village property in the city, to earn rent difference; change to the tenant side, hope to be able to live in a good one But the rent is not too high.</p>

					<p>For urban villages, transformation is imminent. There are some measures to transform it.
 The transformation mode is guided by the government and led by the market. The transformation is to rebuild, rebuild and maintain. The compensation for demolition is mainly based on monetary compensation and property rights replacement. 1.Correctly understand the profound significance of the transformation of urban villages to the economic and social development of our office.
2.We should explore and improve the operation mode and financing mode of urban villages.
3.Policies should be taken first and the interests of all parties should be co-ordinate.

					<p>After renovation, houses are not occupying valuable urban construction sites. In terms of environment, streets will be clean and tidy, and there will be necessary infrastructure. In short, the urban village reconstruction plan is very conducive to the development of the city, first, this can give young people a good living environment. Second, it can make Shenzhen truly move towards an international modern city. Finally, we can make Shenzhen more beautiful and better in the future.

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Throw garbage can be seen everywhere, such narrow roads that hardly could pass through vehicles, a whole big family lives in a small,old house. These are the conditions of life for the people living in the urban villages in shenzhen. No matter of the environment of their lives or the security here is worrying. However, when being asked if they’d like to transform the city,different people have different attitudes. Along with the urban village reconstruction plan, they are also facing the different conditions.
Few people who own the house is positive to the changing plan. They are dying to see a cleaner place to live in. But they are worried about the small area of their own house when it rebuilds. Many people who lived there to search for their next job is negative about that, as the reconstruction about the villages, the price for the house is higher. As they can’t afford that without a high-salary work or even without a work, they insist to refuse the transformation.
In my own opinion, this urban village transformation is imminent and necessary. As an economically developed city, every piece of the land in shenzhen is precious. We could create more value on these occupied lands instead of making it a dirty and messy village. With the rapid development of the economy and the high level of urbanization, changing the city village into a better place can make shenzhen a more international city. 
Though the high rent may send some of the workers home seems to be so cruel or lack of humanization, these small sacrifices could give us back a more rapid development, a highly civilized and modernized city. 
As a matter of fact, it is a real successful project. A project that really considerate for people’s life and benefit to the city development.
