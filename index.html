			<h2>Shenzhen introduction</h2>
			<p>Shenzhen is located in the south of Guangdong Province. Shenzhen is the first special economic zone set up in China, the window of China's reform and opening up and a new immigrant city. It has developed into an influential modern and international metropolis. Now, it plays an important role in China's high-tech industries, financial services, foreign trade exports, marine transport, creative culture and so on. However, with the rapid development of Shenzhen's economy and the high level of urbanization, there are some serious problems, which are ignored by many people - the phenomenon of village in city. City village, as the name implies, the countryside in the city, in fact, is the rural settlement in the city after the village farmland is taken away, the remaining homestead is surrounded by the city. The village in the city is an organic part of a city. The urban village in Shenzhen is growing with the development of economy; it undertakes the heavy responsibility of low-rent housing and reduces the operation cost of the whole city, but it also brings serious economic, social and environmental problems to Shenzhen. In terms of economy, the existence of villages in cities has caused the diseconomy of land use. A large number of urban villages are located in various districts of Shenzhen, occupying valuable urban construction sites. In terms of environment, most urban villages are backward in planning and lack the necessary infrastructure. All kinds of pipelines are in disorder, sewage is discharged randomly, rubbish is piled up, mosquitoes and flies are bred, and living conditions are bad.

					<p> After renovation, houses are not occupying valuable urban construction sites. In terms of environment, streets will be clean and tidy, and there will be necessary infrastructure. In short, the urban village reconstruction plan is very conducive to the development of the city, first, this can give young people a good living environment. Second, it can make Shenzhen truly move towards an international modern city. Finally, we can make Shenzhen more beautiful and better in the future.Pu village was once the largest city village in Shanghai. Since 2000, it has ushered in a large number of people coming to Shanghai. Around 2008, the village with a household registration population of less than 2,000 inhabited more than 31,000 people in Shanghai.

As early as 2015, near the Hongqiao transport hub, here almost every five minutes there is a plane whistling from head to head, from the alley by the river, certification, loans, drug sales of all kinds of "psoriasis" advertising paper everywhere, as long as the wall.
There are not only security risks, but also environmental concerns.
They also adopted a series of reform policies to solve these problems in urban villages.
In short, the reconstruction of Shenzhen's urban villages is an urgent issue. Only by taking proper measures to[ solve the problem properly, Shenzhen will have a better future.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Shanghai is set to blaze a trail in advancing tech-led healthcare in China.Connectivity is going to play a big part in this.

				<p>existing health planning through much better coordinated management of patient care. Improving electronic medical records (EMR) is one example of this. By introducing an integrated EMR system based on more dynamic collection and utilisation of data, providers here can access and leverage more information than ever before. This helps the individual to focus on preventive action to avoid deterioration of health. Additionally, it enables the providers better understand their patients’ health issues, leading to improved diagnosis and more informed treatment and rehabilitation. This is just one way in which tech is improving public health.</p>

					<h3>Smart business</h3>
				</header>
				<p>New technologies are leading to new ways of thinking. A pivot toward a more customer experience-centred approach is particularly evident in Shanghai’s sophisticated finance sector. Investments in areas like the credit system, e-transactions, clearing and tax are poised to take connectivity in financial services to a whole new level.
Fintech is perhaps the best illustration of this dynamism and disruption. It has gathered a substantial head of steam in Shanghai and is already disrupting the traditional value chain. Tech-oriented market entrants are adding innovations to products and services that had formerly been the preserve of the traditional players.
A renowned financial center with strong assets and a deep talent pool, Shanghai is well placed to make the most of fintech. An important precondition for success is the ability to meet customer needs ever more precisely and deliver great experiences. The onus is on financial services firms to deliver truly customer–</p>

				<p>centric solutions if they hope to serve a rising new client base of digital natives and remain relevant and continue to retain their existing customers.
Another challenge for Shanghai is to keep cultivating innovative new entrants who will bring new business models with them and help enhance the eco-system. More digitally-savvy influence and impact, such as leveraging a Chief Digital Officer — could help in this regard.
The speed at which ideas travel in today’s ever more interconnected world can make the whole challenge look incredibly daunting. But that same interconnectivity means that a municipality like Shanghai can see what’s emerging in other cities and then make a judgement about whether it would work in the Shanghai context.

					<h3>Mobility and connectivity</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This rapid pace of information sharing doesn’t seem to faze the young people of Shanghai. “Always on” and entirely at ease with social media, they are adopting new ways of living powered by mobile technology.
A fertile tech sector and high degree of mobile Internet penetration can be found throughout China, but particularly in Shanghai. The city is well placed to capitalize on these new concepts.
Mobile phone maps, navigation and online ride-hailing services make it easier than ever to get around town. At the same time, environmental monitoring is becoming more consistent and verifiable. This is reinforcing efforts to lower emissions and helping to make commitments to targets more manageable and realistic than ever.
Education services are proliferating through a dizzying range of websites and apps, supporting learning for all ages, as well as connecting teachers, administrators and parents. You can now learn about almost anything, anywhere. Once insurmountable curbs to people’s potential now seem relics of some bygone age.

				<p>Focus on innovation and development, and insist on innovation as the first driving force for development
An Economy in Transition: From “Made in China” to “Made by China”
China’s goal is to move away from being the “factory of the world” towards one driven by the innovation economy. The shift will be rooted in plans for high-quality production and advanced manufacturing, powered by green and clean technologies.
China’s clean technology agenda already includes ambitious goals:
•	Renewable energy over coal-powered electricity production. China has quickly become a dominant player in clean electricity production and related technology, with plans to spend at least USD $360 billion on renewable energy by 2020 in order to increasingly power its own cities and industries.

				<p>
•	Rapid adoption of electric vehicles. The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is being accelerated in China thanks to significant incentives. Shanghai, for example, offers free license plates to EV owners, a savings of $11,000 over conventionally-fueled vehicles. The city of Shenzhen (home of Chinese automaker BYD Co Ltd) has already deployed 14,000 electric buses and more than 2,000 electric taxis.
•	An increasing focus on smart cities. Sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, big data analytics, and other technology are increasingly helping Chinese cities improve the efficiency of service delivery and the overall quality of life for millions of urban residents.
China is rapidly becoming a leader in these areas. They recognize the benefits in terms of improved quality of life and a cleaner environment, and are benefiting economically as the world’s largest exporter of EVs, as well as renewable energy technology (e.g., wind and solar). They also recognize the opportunities to share what they’ve learned with the world.

In summary
The drive to implement an Internet plus strategy in Shanghai is leading to opportunities that are expanding connectivity across almost every aspect of city life. These range from the provision of healthcare and education, to the environment in which folks here live and how they do business. We believe that the bold moves Shanghai is making today will help it be one of the world’s truly smart cities for others to follow.

			<h2>Shanghai comparing</h2>
			<p>GLOBAL Chairman, PwC International Limited
Shanghai has begun its journey on an exciting new path to become a truly smart city. By exploiting the Internet and related technologies to the full, it aims to be a center of technological innovation that reaps rewards in terms of both business results and cultural transformation.
PwC defines the backdrop as one that is shaped by five global “megatrends.” These span demographic and social change; a shift in global economic power; rapid urbanization; climate change and resource scarcity; and, of course, technological breakthroughs.
The impact of the last of those megatrends — technological breakthroughs — cannot be overstated for a city like Shanghai. This is particularly the case as it embraces the strategy of “Internet plus” —leveraging the interplay between the Internet, manufacturing and commerce. Indeed, PwC’s latest annual CEO survey finds that tech advances are seen by business leaders as the dominant factor in reshaping their businesses over the next five years.
Along with the greater accessibility and connectivity that comes with the spread of technology, PwC expects a swathe of other innovations, applications and implications. To help make sense of it all, we drew up a list of eight essential tech breakthroughs. These are: artificial intelligence, robots, drones, augmented reality, virtual reality, blockchain, Internet of Things and 3D printing.
While there is clearly no shortage of challenges and opportunities, I would now like to focus in on three areas that are great opportunities for Shanghai. These are: improved health, smart business, and mobility underpinned by connectivity.
