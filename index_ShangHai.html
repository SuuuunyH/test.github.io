Wanda Commercial Plaza, Maccott Jinyi Plaza Hotel, and Hualian Festival City Shopping Center are also under construction. In the future, Wujiaochang will be a sub-center of the city integrating the university campus, science and technology park, modern living area and modern service area. The planned Fortune International Plaza is a CBD project integrating business, office and leisure. It is located in the bustling commercial area of Wujiaochang City Sub-center, just across the road from RT-Mart and B&Q, and Shanghai Wanda Commercial Plaza is also attractive.

				<p style="text-align: center;">The Wujiaochang are changing with each passing day, and the traffic environment has changed from dirty, chaotic, and poor to clean, homogeneous, and beautiful. The high-rise buildings have risen from the ground, and the quality of life of the residents has been greatly improved. The spacious roads and the endless vehicles have brought vitality to the area.
  Looking at the Wujiaochang with high-rise buildings, wide roads, convenient transportation and prosperous market, we deeply feel that reform and opening up have brought us real changes in economy, culture, life, etc. I firmly believe that in the near future, our towns It will become more beautiful, our living conditions will become more and more comfortable, more and more intelligent, and our life will be better. )
